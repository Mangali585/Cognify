    <h1>Amazon Rainforest</h1><hr>
    <img src="amazon.jpeg" alt="amazon" width="600">
    <p>The Amazon Rainforest, often referred to as the "lungs of the Earth," is the largest tropical rainforest in the world,<br> 
        covering approximately 5.5 million square kilometers across nine South American countries, with the majority<br> 
        located in Brazil. It is home to an estimated 390 billion trees and around 16,000 different species, making it one<br> 
        of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet. The Amazon plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate <br>
        by absorbing vast amounts of carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. It is also home to millions of animal species, <br>
        including jaguars, macaws, sloths, and countless insects, many of which are found nowhere else in the world. Indigenous<br> 
        tribes have lived in harmony with the forest for thousands of years, preserving its resources and maintaining their <br>
        unique cultures. However, deforestation, illegal mining, and climate change pose significant threats to the Amazon,<br> 
        leading to habitat destruction, biodiversity loss, and disruptions in global weather patterns. Conservation efforts <br>
        are ongoing, with organizations and governments working to protect this vital natural wonder for future generations.

    <p><b>1. Biodiversity & Wildlife</b><ul>
        <li>The Amazon is home to over 3 million species of plants and animals and over 400 billion individual trees from about 16,000 species.
        <li>Iconic species include jaguars, sloths, pink river dolphins, poison dart frogs, macaws, and anacondas.</li>
        <li>The rainforest is also rich in insects, with millions of unidentified species yet to be classified.</li></ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>2. Indigenous Tribes & Cultures</b><ul>
        <li>More than 400 indigenous tribes live in the Amazon, some with little or no contact with the outside world.</li>
        <li>The Yanomami, Kayapo, and Tikuna are a few of the well-known indigenous groups.</li>
        <li>These tribes have vast knowledge of medicinal plants, survival techniques, and sustainable forest living.</li></ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>3. Climate & Environmental Impact</b><ul>
        <li>The Amazon produces 20% of the world's oxygen, earning it the title of “Lungs of the Earth.”</li>
        <li>It stores vast amounts of carbon dioxide, helping to regulate global temperatures.</li>
        <li>Deforestation, fires, and illegal mining are major threats, contributing to climate change and biodiversity loss.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p><b>4. Unique Ecosystems & Geography</b><ul><li>The Amazon River is the second longest in the world, spanning over 6,575 km (4,345 miles) and supplying 20% of the world’s freshwater.</li>
        <li>The rainforest contains diverse ecosystems, including flooded forests, cloud forests, and savannas.</li>
        <li>Some trees in the Amazon can grow over 60 meters (200 feet) tall, with massive canopies.</li></ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>5. Economic & Medicinal Importance</b><ul><li>The Amazon is a source of rare medicinal plants, many used in cancer, malaria, and pain treatments.</li>
        <li>The forest provides food, timber, and resources that sustain local and global industries.</li>
        <li>Ecotourism is a growing industry, promoting conservation while benefiting local communities.</li></ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>6. Threats & Conservation Efforts</b><ul><li>Over 17% of the Amazon has been deforested in the last 50 years due to logging, agriculture, and cattle ranching.</li>
        <li>Organizations like WWF, Rainforest Alliance, and Amazon Watch work to protect the region.</li>
        <li>Reforestation projects, indigenous land rights protection, and sustainable farming are key to conservation.</li></ul>
